electronic copy available at: the sars-cov-2 virus was isolated and named on february 11, 2020 eight days later, the standard and poors 500 index reached an all-time close level at 3,393.52 many quantitative firms have suffered substantial losses during the subsequent selloff this is true even among funds that offer market neutral strategies at the same time, market makers have enjoyed above-average profits during the selloff. why? what lessons can we learn amid this crisis?1. more nowcasting, less forecasting2. develop theories, not trading rules3. avoid all-regime strategies the following observations are the result of joint work with prof. alexander liptonthis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. electronic copy available at: #1more nowcasting, less forecastingthis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. electronic copy available at: is the past4 forecasting models use structured datato make long-range predictions traditionally, quant strategies have focused on forecasting prices based on price time-series dynamics (e.g., stat arb, ctas) based on cross-sectional data (e.g., asset pricing, factor investing) forecasting relies on statistical relationships between lagged observations and future outcomes these relationships do not always hold forecasting made a lot of sense years ago, when datasets were limited, and disclosures were few and infrequentfactor investing strategies often determine the cheapness or richness of a security as a function of their exposure to a few fundamental factors, which are reported infrequently. these models do not adjust quickly to changing market conditions.this preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. electronic copy available at: nowcasting is the future5 nowcasting models use unstructured datasets to make direct measurements: the target variable is directly observed (e.g. the basket of products used to estimate inflation) short-range predictions: the target variable is not directly observed (e.g., parking lot occupancy used to estimate revenue) advantages relative to forecasts: direct measurements always hold true (they do not rely on a statistical lead-lag relationship) short-range predictions are statistically more reliable than long-range predictions in both cases, estimates involve millions of recent observationsthe billion price project collects daily pricefluctuations associated with tens of millions ofproducts sold by thousands of online retailers inalmost 100 countries.source: cavallo and rigobon [2016]this preprint

covid-19 selloff started, there were plenty of warning signs that the virus was disrupting critical supply chains in china thanks to their nowcasting of orderflowimbalance, very few market makers experienced losses during the selloff this selloff may have been a black swan to market forecasters, but to market nowcasters, it was a white swan it is time for quants to pay less attention to crystal balls, and add nowcasting to their arsenalon january 23, 2020, the central government of china imposed a lockdown in wuhan and other cities in hubei province. the sudden drop in factory demand caused a selloff in various commodities, while u.s. stocks continued to rally.this preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. electronic copy available at: #2develop theories, not trading rulesthis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. electronic copy available at: overfitting everywhere11 when correctly done, backtesting is a useful validation tool it is common for academics and practitioners to run tens of thousands of historical backtests in order to identify a promising investment strategy the best performing backtest is then reported as if a single trial had taken place, and selected for publication, or for launching a new fund as a result of this selection bias, most published discoveries in finance are false this fact explains why many funds have not performed as expected, including but not limited to the recent performance of quant funds during the covid-19 crisisit is trivial to produce a historical walk-forward backtest with a high sharpe ratio, by trying thousands of alternative model specifications. virtually no academic papers report the number of trials involved in a discovery.this preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. electronic copy available at: is validation, not research12 in the scientific method, testing plays a critical role in attempting to refute a hypothesis in finance, however, researchers have used backtesting for the opposite objective, i.e., for building trading rules this misuse leads to a circular argument1. a researcher backtests thousands of trading rules (e.g., the factor zoo)2. the best performing rule is proposed as a hypothesis (e.g., buy low p/e stocks)3. the researcher publishes his hypothesis, and presents as evidence the same backtest that he used to find the hypothesisscientists cant bake their cake and eat it too. a scientist must formulate a hypothesis, so that colleagues can independently test it. scientists cannot pick how their theories will be tested (backtesting or otherwise).this preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. electronic copy available at: theories, not trading rules13 researchers should develop theorieswithout backtesting e.g., with feature importance analysis methods that are robust to overfitting a functional theory explains a phenomenon by exposing a precise cause-effect mechanism the validity of this cause-effect mechanism must be tested through backtesting (adjusted for selection bias), and collecting evidence against the ultimate implications of the proposed theory backtesting trading rules is not enoughsuppose a theory that explains the covid-19 selloff as a market panic, similar to the flash crash of 2010. backtesting a strategy that profited from both events does not validate the theory. a better test is to search for evidence of panic behavior in the fix messages of both days (e.g., market makers becoming like liquidity takers). source: codeofview.comthis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. electronic copy available at: #3avoid all-regime strategiesthis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. electronic copy available at: futile search for the holy grail15 academics and practitioners usually search for investment strategies that would have performed well across all market regimes e.g., risk premia, risk parity, long otm puts the likelihood that genuine all-regime strategies exist is rather slim, because markets are adaptive investors learn from mistakes even if all-regime strategies existed, they are likely to be a rather insignificant subset of the population of strategies that work across one or more regimesmost strategies are backtested over decades (sometimes even centuries!) to imply that they work under all market regimes. and yet, the current zero-rate environment makes those backtests unrepresentative.source: federal reserve bank of st. louis. treasury constant maturity ratesthis preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. electronic copy available at: investment strategies16 asset managers should focus their efforts on searching for investment strategies that perform optimally under specific market regimes each regime is characterized by a particular data generating process (dgp) we can nowcast the probability that current observations are being drawn from each dgp, and use those probabilities to build an ensemble portfolio of those optimal strategies this approach allows funds to adapt as market conditions change e.g., use nowcasting to switch from risk-on (risk premia) to risk-off (long otm puts) strategies in the advent of black swansregime-specific investment strategies are common among market makers. it allows them to adapt to new market conditions quickly. thanks to nowcasting, funds can apply the same approach to strategy deployment.this preprint research paper has not been peer reviewed. electronic copy available at: graphs17 a knowledge graph links companies based on multiple criteria, such as business ties, supply chain, competitors, industrial sectors, shared ownership, etc. knowledge graphs encode forward-looking information about a regime we can use this information to derive theory-implied correlation matrices (tics) a tic blends theoretical (forward-looking) codependence structure with empirical observations drawn from history this allows for risk models to be

was led by markowitz optimization. machine learning is the second wave and it will touch every aspect of finance. lpez de prados advances in financial machine learning is essential for readers who want to be ahead of the technology rather than being replaced by it. prof. campbell harvey, duke university. former president of the american finance association.financial problems require very distinct machine learning solutions. dr. lpez de prados book is the first one to characterize what makes standard machine learning tools fail when applied to the field of finance, and the first one to provide practical solutions to unique challenges faced by asset managers. everyone who wants to understand the future of finance should read this book. prof. frank fabozzi, edhec business school.
